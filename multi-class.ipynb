The authority of the Corporation to issue shares&#13;\\nmay be limited by resolution of the board of directors of the Corporation (the&#13;\\n\"Board of Directors\").  Shares may be issued from time to time for such&#13;\\nconsideration in money or property (tangible or intangible) or labor or services&#13;\\nactually performed as the Board of Directors may determine in their sole&#13;\\njudgment and without the necessity of action by the holders of Shares.  Common&#13;\\nShares may not be issued in series.  Shares may not be issued until paid for&#13;\\nand, when issued, are nonassessable.  Fractional Shares may not be issued by the&#13;\\nCorporation and, in the event fractional shares are or may become outstanding,&#13;\\nthe Corporation shall redeem said shares at the then market price.&#13;\\n  (b)  Preferred Shares.  The designation, preferences, relative rights, and&#13;\\n       -----------------                                                    &#13;\\nlimitations of Preferred Shares are as follows:&#13;\\n       (i)  Issuance in Series.  The Board of Directors is authorized to act by&#13;\\n            -------------------                                                &#13;\\nresolution, subject to limitations prescribed by the laws of the Sate of&#13;\\nColorado, the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation (the&#13;\\n\"Bylaws\"), and previous resolutions by the Board of Directors limiting this&#13;\\nauthorization, to provide for the issuance of Preferred Shares in series.  To&#13;\\nexercise this authority the Board of Directors must first designate the series&#13;\\nso established, and, secondly, fix and determine the relative rights,&#13;\\npreferences, and limitations of the Preferred Shares in the series established&#13;\\nto the extent not fixed and determined by these Articles of Incorporation.  The&#13;\\nextent of this authority, with respect to each series established, is to be&#13;\\ndetermined by reference to the \"Colorado Corporation Code,\" articles 1 through&#13;\\n10, inclusive, of title 7, Colorado Revised States, as amended.  Without&#13;\\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing, this authority includes fixing and&#13;\\ndetermining the following:&#13;\\n            1.  the number of Preferred Shares which may be issued under the&#13;\\nseries established, and the designation of such series;&#13;\\n&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;\\n &#13;\\n            2.  the rate of dividend on Preferred Shares of that series, if any,&#13;\\nthe time of payment of dividends, whether dividends shall be cumulative, and, if&#13;\\ncumulative, the date from which dividends shall begin accruing;&#13;\\n            3.  whether Preferred Shares of that series may be redeemed, and, if&#13;\\nredeemable, the redemption price, terms, and conditions of redemption;&#13;\\n            4.  whether to establish a sinking fund or make other provisions for&#13;\\nthe redemption or purchase of Preferred Shares of that series;&#13;\\n            5. the amount payable per Preferred Share of that series in the&#13;\\nevent of the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Corporation, whether&#13;\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily;&#13;\\n            6.  voting powers, if any, of the series; and&#13;\\n            7.  whether the series shall have conversion privileges, and, if&#13;\\nconvertible, the terms and conditions upon which Preferred Shares of that series&#13;\\nshall be convertible, including, without limitation, the provision, if any, for&#13;\\nadjustment of the conversion rate and the payment of additional amounts by&#13;\\nholders of such shares upon the exercise of this privilege.&#13;\\n  Irrespective of the limitations set forth in subsection (i)1. of this Section&#13;\\n(b), the Board of Directors may, at any time after the number of Preferred&#13;\\nShares authorized under a series has been established, authorize the issuance of&#13;\\nadditional Preferred Shares of the same series or reduce the number of Preferred&#13;\\nShares authorized under such series.&#13;\\n  All Preferred Shares shall be identical to each other in all respects, except&#13;\\nas those relative rights, preferences, and limitations established by the Board&#13;\\nof Directors pursuant to its authority as determined by reference to the&#13;\\nColorado Corporation Code and as established in subsections (i)1 through (i)7 ,&#13;\\ninclusive, of this Section (b), as to which there may be variations between&#13;\\nseries.&#13;\\n  (ii)  Dividend Rights.  The holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to&#13;\\n        ----------------                                                 &#13;\\nreceive when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors in its sole&#13;\\ndiscretion, but only out of funds available therefor under the laws of the State&#13;\\nof Colorado, cumulative, partially cumulative, and non-cumulative dividends, as&#13;\\nthe case may be.  Dividends may be paid in such cash, property, or Preferred&#13;\\nShares of the same series (including Preferred Share of the same series held as&#13;\\ntreasury Preferred Shares) as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may&#13;\\ndetermine upon the date fixed and at the intervals determined by the Board of&#13;\\nDirectors.  Dividends will accrue, if cumulative or partially cumulative,&#13;\\nwhether or not earned or declared from the date or dates determined by the Board&#13;\\nof Directors.  Full dividends on the Preferred Shares of all series for all past&#13;\\nperiods and for the then current period must be paid, or declared and a sum&#13;\\nsufficient for such payment be set apart, before any dividends may be declared&#13;\\nor paid upon or set apart for, or before any other distribution may be declared&#13;\\nor made in respect of, the Common Shares.  Accruals of dividends shall not bear&#13;\\ninterest.&#13;\\n  As long as Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall not&#13;\\ndeclare, set apart for payment, pay any dividends (other than dividends payable&#13;\\nin Common Shares), make any distribution on any Common Shares, redeem, purchase&#13;\\nor to otherwise acquire, or permit any&#13;\\n&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;\\n &#13;\\nsubsidiary to purchase, or otherwise acquire any Common Shares if at the time of&#13;\\nmaking such declaration, payment, distribution, redemption, purchase, or&#13;\\nacquisition the Corporation is in default with respect to any dividend payable&#13;\\non, or any obligation to redeem or retire, Preferred Shares.  Notwithstanding&#13;\\nthe foregoing, however, the Corporation may at any time (i) redeem, purchase, or&#13;\\notherwise acquire Common Shares in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds&#13;\\nfrom the sale of Common Shares and (ii) acquire Common Shares that are held by&#13;\\nfirms or corporations acquired by the Corporation, whether by merger,&#13;\\nconsolidation, purchase of assets, exchange of securities, or otherwise.&#13;\\n  (iii)  Redemption.  On the sole authority and option of the Board of Directors&#13;\\n         -----------                                                            &#13;\\nthe Corporation may redeem all or any part of any series of Preferred Shares&#13;\\noutstanding upon the terms (including redemption price) and conditions, in the&#13;\\nmanner, and upon such notice as is determined by the Board of Directors.  No&#13;\\nredemption may be made, however, until all dividends accrued to the redemption&#13;\\ndate on all series of Preferred Shares have been paid, or until declared and a&#13;\\nsum sufficient in amount set aside for such payment.  If less than all the&#13;\\nPreferred Shares of a series are to be redeemed on any one date set for&#13;\\nredemption, the shares designated for redemption may be in such amount ant&#13;\\ndetermined by such method, whether by lot, pro rata or otherwise, and subject to&#13;\\nsuch other provisions as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine&#13;\\nin it s sole discretion.&#13;\\n  Preferred Shares of any series which have been redeemed (whether by sinking&#13;\\nfund or otherwise) shall have the status of authorized and unissued Preferred&#13;\\nShares, unless the Board of Directors in its sole discretion cancels such&#13;\\nshares.  Preferred Shares which have been redeemed, unless canceled, may be&#13;\\nreissued as a part of the series of which they were originally a part, or may be&#13;\\nreclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Shares created by&#13;\\nresolution of the Board of Directors or as part of any other series of Preferred&#13;\\nShares.&#13;\\n  (iv)  Liquidation Rights.  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or&#13;\\n        -------------------                                                  &#13;\\nwinding up of the Corporation, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, which&#13;\\nresults in any distribution of the assets of the Corporation to its&#13;\\nShareholders, the holders of Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled&#13;\\nto an amount per share equal to that amount fixed by the Board of Directors upon&#13;\\nthe initial issuance of the Preferred Share of the series of which the Preferred&#13;\\nShares in question are a part before any distribution of the assets of the&#13;\\nCorporation may be made to or set apart for the holders of Common Shares.&#13;\\n  If assets of the Corporation distributable to the holder of Preferred Shares&#13;\\nare insufficient for the payment to them of the full preferential amount&#13;\\ndescribed above, such assets shall be distributed ratably among the holders of&#13;\\nthe Preferred Shares of all series in accordance with the amounts which would be&#13;\\npayable on such distribution if all sums payable were discharged in full unless&#13;\\nthe Board of Directors upon the initial issuance of any series of Preferred&#13;\\nShares has provided otherwise.  After payment in full of the preferential&#13;\\namounts required to be paid to the holders of the Preferred Shares than&#13;\\noutstanding, the holder of Common Share shall be entitled, to the exclusion of&#13;\\nthe holders of Preferred Shares, to share in all remaining assets of the&#13;\\nCorporation in accordance with their respective interests unless the Board of&#13;\\nDirectors upon the initial issuance of any series of Preferred Shares, or&#13;\\notherwise, has provided otherwise.&#13;\\n  For purposes of this article and any statement filed pursuant to law setting&#13;\\nforth the designation, description, and term of any series of Preferred Shares&#13;\\nthe voluntary sale, lease,&#13;\\n&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;\\n &#13;\\nexchange, or transfer (for cash, securities or other consideration) of all or&#13;\\nsubstantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation to, or its&#13;\\nconsolidation or merger with, any other corporation or corporations shall not be&#13;\\ndeemed to be a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation,&#13;\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily.&#13;\\n  (v)  Voting Rights.

The Company shall&#13;\\nnot effect any transaction described in this subsection 5(e)(iii) unless (a) it&#13;\\nfirst gives thirty (30) business days prior notice of&#13;\\n&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;\\n &#13;\\nsuch merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,&#13;\\nreorganization, or other similar event (during which time the Holder shall be&#13;\\nentitled to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock)&#13;\\nand (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Company) assumes&#13;\\nby written instrument the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of&#13;\\nDesignation including this subsection 5(e)(iii).&#13;\\n              (iv) No Fractional Shares. If any adjustment under this Section&#13;\\n5(e) would create a fractional share of Common Stock or a right to acquire a&#13;\\nfractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be disregarded and&#13;\\nthe number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be the next&#13;\\nlower number of shares.&#13;\\n     Section 6.
